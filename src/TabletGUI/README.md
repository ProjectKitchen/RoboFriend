# Source for GUI

The files in this folder are needed on the tablet, which will be used as GUI. 

## Setup

Before you can run the GUI you have to install Python 27. For help, information and download visit https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/

After successfully installation of Python27 make sure to install pygame, too. As of this Sourcecode there only was Pygame 1.9.1 available, so it would be recommended to install this version. As of today, there would also be Pygame 1.9.3 available but this source hasn't been tested with this Release. You can find the different Releases and more information under: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

To run spielgui.py all files in the folder TabletGUI need to be copied into the Python27 path on your computer. Then you should be able to run spielgui.py either by double-klicking or in the windows shell with the command "python spielgui.py"

Buttons.py is a library, which is used in spielgui.py and in the folder "data" you will find all kind of pictures and symbols which are displayed somewhere in GUI.
