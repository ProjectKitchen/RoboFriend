# Robofriend

Robofriend - a semi-autonomous, remotely controllable robot companion.

Robofriend - initially created by Tom Heike 2002 - was exhibited at several Roboexotica events, serving drinks at the Vienniese Cocktail Robot Festival.
In 2014, two Robofriends were donated by Tom to us, and were further developed by Dr. Wummi and Karima Khlousy-Neirukh.


Robofriend shall be used to evaluate playful interaction with kids with cognitive disabilites in special schools in Vienna.
For this purpose, several game applications were developed which involve robot movements and expressions.

The Robofriend platform was based on a VIA Epia single board PC and a C-Control microcontroller, 
which have been replaced by a RaspberryPi-2 and a Teensy microcontroller as low-level interface.

Features:
* live video transmission (low latency) 
* remote control via webbrowser or game apps
* proximity sensors for collision avoidance & activity detection
* facial expressions, sound/voice playback
* RFID reader - utilized for game interaction
* unique design (with CRT-head) by Tom Heike
